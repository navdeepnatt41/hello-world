# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the Github Flow.

## Introduction
My name is Navdeep Natt. I am a Computer Science Major at UIC.

## About this Repo
I'm re-introducing myself to Github to develop a deeper, more comprehensive grasp of this tool.
Ideally, I will begin to always use GitHub as a means of engaging in good CS fundamentals and 
gaining more practice.
